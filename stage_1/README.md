Replacing letters (rather than words) with black boxes is a sharper, more precise approach. It retains important structural cues like word length and morphology. This could be better—more subtle, more rigorous.

**Why it’s a stronger experiment**:

1. **Preserves Morphological Information**:
   - Words retain unique shapes, which help disambiguate them.
   - You test more nuanced linguistic theories about how shape and length affect readability.

2. **Reduces Ambiguity Slightly**:
   - Less chance of immediate collision; "run" (███) differs clearly from "running" (███████).
   - But enough ambiguity remains to force genuine structural learning.

3. **Maintains Visual Rhythm**:
   - More accurately encodes language rhythm at a finer granularity.
   - Closer to natural reading and cognition, where word shape matters.

**Example Comparison**:

| Original             | Word-Block (earlier) | Letter-Block (new)  |
|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| "Yes."               | "█."                 | "███."              |
| "Are you sure?"      | "█ █ █?"             | "███ ███ ████?"     |
| "Life moves fast."   | "█ █ █."             | "████ █████ ████."  |

### **Updated Dataset Example (JSON):**

```json
{
  "examples": [
    {"id": "001", "text": "The sun rose slowly.", "blocked": "███ ███ ████ ██████."},
    {"id": "002", "text": "Are you awake yet?", "blocked": "███ ███ █████ ███?"},
    {"id": "003", "text": "Either say something useful.", "blocked": "██████ ███ █████████ ██████."},
    {"id": "004", "language": "German", "text": "Die Nacht ist dunkel.", "blocked": "███ █████ ███ ██████."}
  ]
}
```

### **Why Do It This Way?**

- You explicitly measure the cognitive and computational impact of **word shape**.
- The model can't cheat easily by just counting words; it must infer structure from subtle length and punctuation patterns.
- Allows stronger comparison with linguistic psychology theories about reading (e.g., [Word Shape Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_recognition#Word_shape)).

### **Challenges to Consider**:

- Some collisions still exist: "cat" vs. "dog" (both ███). These minimal pairs will serve as controls for ambiguity.
- Visual complexity increases: ensure your transformer model clearly distinguishes subtle shape differences.

---

### **Practical Next Step**:

- Update your dataset generation to use letter-block replacement (one "█" per letter).
- Run the previously provided transformer training script with the new dataset.

This refinement makes your experiment smarter, more specific, and genuinely insightful. It’s a superior starting point.
