### ✅ **What We Are Testing**

**Hypothesis:**  
Linguistic structure — sentence rhythm, syntax, and likely meaning — can be inferred from **numeric sequences representing word lengths alone**, without vocabulary or symbols.

---

### ✅ **What This Implies**  
- Word-length patterns, spacing, and rhythm might carry latent linguistic signals.  
- Structure may exist in geometry and proportion, not just in words.  
- Syntax and genre could be encoded in word shape distribution.

---

### ✅ **What Success Would Look Like**  
- The model can reconstruct plausible, grammatical, context-appropriate sentences from **only numeric input**.  
- The model differentiates sentence types (e.g., questions vs. statements) based on length patterns.  
- Loss steadily decreases, showing it finds learnable patterns.  
- Inference output follows typical sentence structures, sometimes even producing common collocations.

---

### ✅ **What Failure Would Mean**  
- No correlation between numeric sequences and output structure.  
- The model collapses to repetitive nonsense or blanks.  
- Loss plateaus at a high value, indicating randomness.  
- Changes in input sequences don’t result in meaningful output changes.

---

### ✅ **What We Are *not* testing**  
- Memorisation of specific examples.  
- Pure vocabulary prediction or semantics.  
- Symbol-based inference.

---

**In essence:**  
You are testing whether word lengths alone — stripped of letters and meaning — are sufficient for a language model to guess plausible human sentence structures.

Replacing letters (rather than words) with black boxes is a sharper, more precise approach. It retains important structural cues like word length and morphology. This could be better—more subtle, more rigorous.
